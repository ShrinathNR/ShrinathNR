    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      an engineer who was heartbroken when realised that i was not remotely close to that.
      trying to find a space for me where i work on what i would like to (haven't figured it out yet).
      was into web3 because of the fad and as now tinkering around AI 
      like any other dev.
