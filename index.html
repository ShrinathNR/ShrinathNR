    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      an engineer who wants to do build or think about building something. right now juggling btw learning solana and using & fine-tuning modals.
      when i am bored i watch cooking videos on YT or scrolling X-twitter (still name x doesn't feel right) and hackernews.
      you can often catch me cooking at 1 am (prolly fresh pasta, briyani, parota, rava dosa...basically whatever i feel like)
